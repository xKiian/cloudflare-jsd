## Fingerprint

Obtaining a fingerprint is pretty easy.

1. Go to the target Website
2. Copy the code from [get_fingerprint.js](get_fingerprint.js) and paste it into the console (F12 -> Console)
3. Copy the output and paste it into `fingerprint.json`

The script automatically gets the fingerprint and replaces the timestamp with %timestamp% for your convenience
